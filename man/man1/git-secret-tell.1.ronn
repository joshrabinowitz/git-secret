git-secret-tell - adds a person, who can access private data.
===============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

    git secret tell [-m] [-d dir] [emails]...


## DESCRIPTION
`git-secret-tell` receives an email addresses as an input, searches for the `gpg`-key in the `gpg`'s 
`homedir` by these emails, then imports a person's public key into the `git-secret`'s inner keychain. 
From this moment this person can encrypt new files with the keyring which contains their key,
but they cannot decrypt the old files, which were already encrypted without their key. 
The files should be re-encrypted with the new keyring by someone who has the unencrypted files.

**Do not manually import secret key into `git-secret`**. Anyways, it won't work with any of the secret-keys imported.

If you need to pass extra options to gnupg to help it to find your keys (such as using the --auto-key-locate and --keyserver 
options), you can set the environment variable SECRETS_TELL_GPG_OPTIONS.

## OPTIONS

    -m  - takes your current `git config user.email` as an identifier for the key.
    -d  - specifies `--homedir` option for the `gpg`, basically use this option if your store your keys in a custom location.
    -h  - shows help.
